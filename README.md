project on facial recognition using python libraries 

This project implements a automated attendence using facial recognition application that detects, identifies, and verifies individuals based on facial features extracted from images or live video and marks live attendence . The system uses Pythonâ€™s OpenCV and face_recognition libraries, leveraging deep learning models to map facial landmarks and compare them against a trained facial database and uses csv files to record attendence data .
